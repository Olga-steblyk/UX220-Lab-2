        <p>Over the summer, i took hobby of reading. It is something I am trying to evolve as a skill. My latest read is the book called 'Motherthing', as it was recommended by the nice lady at a book store. Written by Ainslie Hogarth, the horror novel mentions the themes of loneliness and abandonment left by a parental figure. While this books goes in to disturbing graphics about the detail and actions in the book, I found the book very fascinating.  </p>
