        <p>Over the summer, I took hobby of reading. It is something I am trying to evolve as a skill. My latest read is the book called 'Motherthing', as it was recommended by the nice lady at a book store. Written by Ainslie Hogarth, the horror novel mentions themes that work well within each other. While this books goes in to disturbing graphics about the detail and actions in the book, I found the book very fascinating.  </p>

        <p>The book does mention and writes about mature topics that is not recommended to younger audiences, such as; graphic depiction of murder, suicide, cannibalism, neglect, abuse in all forms and much more. The story starts with the main character, Abby and her husband, Ralph dealing with the loss of his mother which despised Abby. As Ralph falls into a deeper depression, Abby slowly losses grip of reality as her husbands is only focused on mourning the loss of his mother.Abby is in her own ever longing mourning of her neglectful parental figure. The plot follows Abby trying to cope with a long list of issues all while in her own mental termoil.  </p>
